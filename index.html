This powerful dua is for asking Allah ﷻ — by His Names Ash-Shakūr (The Most Appreciative) and Al-Karīm (The Most Generous) — to not only accept your good deeds, but to enlarge them beyond imagination.

Even a deed as small as a mustard seed can, by His Mercy, be magnified to fill the space between the heavens and the earth.

As Rasulullah ﷺ said:

“Indeed, Allah has recorded the good and the bad deeds...”

He continued:

“Whoever intends a good deed and then does it, Allah records it for him as ten good deeds, up to seven hundred times, or even many more times.”
— (Bukhari & Muslim)

Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Shakur (O Most Appreciative) we ask that You purify and accept all of our good deeds, Ya Kareem (O Most Generous), by Your infinite generosity, we ask that You enlarge them - so much so that even a deed as small as a mustard seed may be magnified to fill the space between the heavens and the earth.

This dua is part of *The Supplication of Infinite Blessings* — a powerful collection of heartfelt supplications designed to benefit you in both this life and the next. 

*At Dua Sharing, our mission is simple*: 

To encourage sincere dua, meaningful sharing, and to multiply blessings through a growing global chain of people making dua for one another every single day.

As Rasulullah ﷺ said: 

“The supplication of a Muslim for his brother in his absence will certainly be answered. Every time he makes a supplication for good for his brother, the angel appointed for this task says: ‘Ameen! And may it be for you too.”

Ameen 🤲`;
